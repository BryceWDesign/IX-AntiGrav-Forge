## Mounting Ring CAD — IX-AntiGrav-Forge Core Structural Component

---

### 📌 Description

This file represents the **primary radial mounting ring** used to align and structurally support the critical elements of IX-AntiGrav-Forge, including:

- Toroidal EM spin-loop coils (×2)
- Ultrasonic phased array transducers (×16+)
- Magnetic coil shell supports (×2)
- Sensor and probe mounts (for flux, IR, acoustic, and inertial feedback)
- Paramagnetic fluid basin interface bracket (optional)

### 🧱 Structural Overview

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Outer Diameter | 400 mm (scalable to 600 mm+) |
| Inner Clearance Diameter | 180 mm (central object zone) |
| Thickness | 8 mm |
| Mounting Holes | 32 (standard M3 spacing, 11.25° radial offset) |
| Sensor Slots | 6 cutouts spaced at 60° intervals for IR / Hall / distance sensors |
| Material Suggestion | PLA, ABS, PETG, or aluminum (if CNC'd) |
| Frame Fit | Standard with 2020 T-slot modular extrusion systems |

### 🔧 Fabrication Notes

- **3D printing:** PLA or PETG recommended for rapid prototyping  
- **Machining:** Aluminum or Delrin for permanent mounting stability  
- **Thermal tolerance:** Maintain minimum coil spacing to avoid melt point with toroid fields >50°C

---

### 📐 Usage

Once printed or machined, this ring:
- Allows perfect angular alignment of opposing toroidal coils
- Houses transducers equidistantly around central lift cavity
- Supports vibration-isolated sensor mounts
- Acts as an interchangeable interface for modular test-bed systems

### 📦 File Notes

The actual `.stl` file should be placed in this directory and uploaded using GitHub’s binary asset interface. A rendered `.svg` or `.png` reference may also be added for quick view in non-CAD environments.

### ✅ Summary

This mounting ring is a **non-electrical critical infrastructure component** in IX-AntiGrav-Forge — enabling structural alignment, signal symmetry, and optimal field geometry for the multi-force environment that this platform operates in.
