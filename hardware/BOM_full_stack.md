### üìå Objective

This document outlines all required components, subcomponents, and materials necessary to physically construct the full IX-AntiGrav-Forge system.  
It is broken down by subsystem, includes reference models, and emphasizes **non-exotic**, commercially available parts only.

No black-box components. No proprietary systems. All items can be sourced or fabricated within standard open-source or research-grade fabrication environments.
