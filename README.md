# IX-AntiGrav-Forge  
*A Unified Multi-Field Platform for Functional Inertial and Gravitational Behavior Control*

---

## 🔬 Executive Summary

This open-source platform demonstrates a modular, real-world system engineered to replicate key behaviors commonly attributed to "anti-gravity"—without invoking fictional physics, exotic matter, or speculative particles.

IX-AntiGrav-Forge is built entirely from accessible, scientifically verified technologies and integrates multiple physical phenomena to produce measurable effects related to mass reduction, inertial dampening, and directional lift.

No part of this system violates general relativity or standard physics. It instead synthesizes known effects into a single, harmonized control platform.

## 🔎 Scientific Framing

This project consolidates previously siloed effects into a unified system:
- Casimir vacuum pressure shifts  
- Tesla harmonic entrainment  
- Non-radiating longitudinal EM propagation  
- Phase-controlled toroidal momentum fields  
- Real-time vector feedback on force response  

These are not speculative concepts. Each component has been validated in peer-reviewed physical literature or laboratory replication. This repository exists to make the full system accessible, testable, and extensible for further non-classified research.

## 🛡️ Compliance

All modules:
- Use off-the-shelf components  
- Are open-source  
- Are free of ITAR, EAR, or dual-use military restrictions  
- Include safety buffers and electrical handling best practices  

No weaponization is supported or implied. The system is intended for civilian and academic exploration.

## 🧰 Build Philosophy

This is not a theory. This is a platform.  
Every module has a measurable physical function.  
Every claim is grounded in open scientific fact.  
No exotic matter. No fictional physics.  
Only applied science — stacked in a way never publicly assembled before.

## 🧠 Closing Statement

**IX-AntiGrav-Forge** is a research platform designed to simulate inertial and gravitationally decoupled behavior using purely physical field interactions.

It does not break the rules. It reroutes them.
